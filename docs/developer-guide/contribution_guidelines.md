# Contributing To the Firmware

Per our vision stated in the [introduction](../index.md), ROSflight is intended to be a streamlined, bare-bones autopilot.  We welcome any bug fixes, cleanup or other contributions which do not add complexity, detract from the readability or simplified nature of the firmware.  We hope that the firmware is useful, but in an attempt to avoid "feature creep" we will be very disciminatory in pull requests whose purpose is to simply add features.
