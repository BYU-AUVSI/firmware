# Contributing To the Firmware

Per our vision stated in the [introduction](../index.md), ROSflight is intended to be a streamlined, bare-bones autopilot.  We welcome any bug fixes, cleanup, or other contributions which do not add complexity, detract from the readability or simplified nature of the firmware.  We hope that the firmware is useful, but in an attempt to avoid "feature creep" we will be very discriminatory in merging pull requests whose purpose is to simply add features.  Forking the repository in order to add features is totally acceptable, just stay in contact with us and recognize us as the original authors of the autopilot. (Per the agreement in the BSD-3 license)

In addition, we strive to maintain a very high standard of quality in terms of code style, variable naming and the like.  We will likely be nit-picky and perhaps a little harsh about this in pull requests.  Please do not be offended.  By maintaining a high standard, we hope that the code will continue to be useful, understandable and cohesive in nature.

# Communication

There are two channels to communicate with the developer team.  For bug reports, feature requests and anything to do with code, please start an Issue on the [github page](https://www.github.com/rosflight/firmware).  For questions and simple discussion, please use the [forum](https://discuss.rosflight.org/).
