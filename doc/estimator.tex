\section{Onboard Estimator Derivation}

The estimator is designed to calculate an estimator of the attitude and angular velocity of the multirotor.  It is assumed that the FCU is mounted rigidly to the body of the aircraft (perhaps with dampening material to remove vibrations from the motors), such that measurements of the onboard IMU are consistent with the motion of the aircraft.

Due to the limited computational power on the embedded processor, and to calculate attitude estimates at speeds up to 1000Hz, a simple complementary filter is used, rather than a Kalman filter.  In practice, this method works extremely well, and it used widely throughout commercially available autopilots.

Accelerometers measure all the forces acting on the aircraft.  We can assume that these forces consist primarily of forces from the propellers, but it often also consists of vibrations from unbalanced motors and propellers, wind, ground effect, and a variety of other sources. One thing accelerometers do \textit{not} measure is acceleration due to gravity.  As a result, if you hold an accelerometer still and look at it's measurements, you'll notice it measures the forces required to hold it in place.  For example, if you set an accelerometer on a table, it will measure the normal force the table exerts on the accelerometer.  If we assume that the accelerometer is at rest (albeit a rather significant assumption for a MAV), then we can assume that the forces acting on the accelerometer must be directly opposite gravity.  If we know the direction of gravity (read, inertial frame) relative to the body-fixed frame of the MAV, then we can back out the attitude of the MAV using the following formula.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\phi_{meas} &= \textrm{atan} \left( \frac{a_x}{a_z} \right)  \\
		\theta_{meas} &= \textrm{atan} \left( \frac{a_y}{a_z}  \right)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

As you might expect, a MAV is not always at rest, so accelerometer measurements tend to bounce around as the MAV accelerates.  There are often also a lot of high-frequency external forces (such as vibrations induced by imbalanced propellers and motors) on a MAV in flight which adds noise to the accelerometer measurement.  We can assume, however, that these accelerations are short-lived, and the accelerometer measurement remains stable over time.  To leverage this fact, we will low-pass filter the sensor data from the accelerometers and use a smoothed-out version to calculate our attitude.

Gyroscopes, on the other hand, directly measure the angular velocity of the IMU.  Gyroscopes are not susceptible to external forces like accelerometers, and instead measure angular velocity directly, but integrating gyroscopes over time to calculate attitude would lead to large amounts of drift.

To get the best of both worlds, we will derive a complementary filter.  This filter will high pass and integrate gyroscope data to get high-frequency measurements, then add low-pass filtered accelerometer data to correct the drift accumulated by integrating the gyroscope.  The transfer function of the complementary filter is shown in Equation~\ref{eq:comp_filter_TF}

\begin{equation}
	\bm{\theta} = \frac{1}{1+Ts}\bm{a} + \frac{Ts}{1+Ts}\frac{1}{s}\bm{\omega}
	\label{eq:comp_filter_TF}
\end{equation}

Transforming into the $z$-domain using backwards difference results in

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	  \bm{\theta_i} &= \alpha \left( \bm{\theta_{i-1}} + \bm{\omega}_i dt  \right) + (1-\alpha) \bm{a}_i
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where
\begin{equation}
	\alpha = \frac{\tau}{\tau + dt}
\end{equation}

and $\tau$ is the desired time constant, and $dt$ is the sample rate.  With sample rates of approximately 7ms, and a desired $\tau$ of 0.2 seconds, $\alpha$ is approximately 0.966.

\subsection{Implementation}

Because the STM32F10x lacks a floating-point unit, and to reduce the amount of time between receiving sensor measurements and writing motor commands, estimation is performed entirely with integers.  A custom atan2 fuction, called turboatan2, performs atan2 via a lookup table (leveraging the identity $\textrm{atan2}(x) = \tfrac{\pi}{2} - \textrm{atan2}\left(\tfrac{1}{x}\right)$ to reduce the memory footprint of the lookup table).  The accelerometer is scaled to return mm/s$^2$, and the gyro is scaled to return $\mu$rad/s$^2$ so as to utilize the scale of 32-bit integers as fully as possible.  The return of turboatan2 is in mrad.  The complementary filter is implemented in estimator.c, and is relatively straight-forward except the need for scaling multiples of these different units to remain in the range of 32-bit integers.

\subsection{Accuracy}

The Invensense MPU6050 has a 16-bit ADC and an accelerometer and gyro onboard.  The accelerometer, when scaled to $\pm$4g, has a resolution of 0.002394 m/s$^2$.  Scaled up to mm/s$^2$ accuracy of the 32-bit integer is capable of representing the full resolution of the accelerometer.  The gyroscope has a range of 500$^\circ$/s, or a resolution of 0.000532632 rad/s.  Scaled up to $\mu$rad/s, the 32-bit integer is more than able to represent the full resolution of the gyroscope.  The lookup table method used by turboatan2 is accurate to $\pm$ 0.001 rad, which means that the scaled measurements provided to the complementary filter are the same resolution of the original measurements by the accelerometer, and any error in the filter is caused by noise in the measurement, not in the numerical conversion to 32-bit integers rather than floating-point.  However, an enourmous boost in speed is available through using an entirely integer-based estimator.
